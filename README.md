For RPi 4, I made a CAN shield and wrote an engine ECU emulation script in python. VCDS sends connection requests to the engine ECU, the script responds as a specific engine model.After that, in the sniffer, I can see what requests VCDS sends.  This is necessary to research the possibilities of diagnosing a specific engine without leaving home.
